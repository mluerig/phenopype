Installation
=============



1. Install Python
-----------------

To get started, download and install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ 
with Python 3. Anaconda is a scientific python distribution which comes with the most common 
scientific Python packages already built in.

You can test if the installation was successfull by opening a terminal and typing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda --version

If :code:`conda` is not recognized, use the anaconda prompt (e.g. through the `Anaconda Navigator 
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/>`_ OR add the path to your Anaconda 
installation directory (e.g. :code:`C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin`) to your environmental variables. Further
help can be found here:

2. Install phenopype
--------------------

First, use :code:`conda` create a virtual environment to have fuller control over your python packages. If you 
prefer an "Rstudio-like" environment, you can use phenpype from an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). My favorite IDE
is Spyder (https://www.spyder-ide.org/); a slightly outdated overview of other popular Python IDEs can be found 
`here <https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments>`_. Phenopype can of course also be run from the 
command line using :code:`python`.

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create -n "pp" python=3.7
	conda install spyder
	
.. important::

	If your are using `Spyder`, make sure you install it to the new environment you have just created, otherwise `Spyder` will be loaded
	from conda base environment, where phenopype is not installed. 


Then activate the virtual environment and install phenopype using `pip` in your terminal or command line:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda activate pp
	pip install phenopype

You can now use phenopype by typing :code:`spyder` or :code:`python` into the command line. If you are unsure to proceed, consult the tutorials.

2.1 Update phenopype
""""""""""""""""""""

For regular major and minor releases do:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install phenopype -U

2.2 Install hotfixes
""""""""""""""""""""

To install bugfixes for a current installation do:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install git+https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype@fix -U

2.3 Install nightly
"""""""""""""""""""

To update to the latest unreleased version of `phenopype`, which can be found on 
`github <https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/tree/nightly>`_, use 'pip' with :code:`git`:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install git+https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype@nightly


.. important::

	Any modifications to the python environments or `Spyder`, should only be done using :code:`conda`, but modifications to `phenopype`, 
	its dependencies or other python packages should only be done using :code:`pip`. Mixing the two installers may break your python enviroment.
	

3. Choose a text editor
-----------------------

The high throughout method in phenopype currently requires a text editor to be installed that **does not lock the file** - `read about file locking here <https://superuser.com/questions/853420/why-is-windows-not-warning-about-file-in-use-for-certain-programs>`_. For Windows, I recommend `Notepad++`, which supports 
syntax highlighting and has many other useful features, for Linux `Vim` or `Nano`, and for MacOS `brackets` could work (http://brackets.io/).

Moreover, it is important that your OS knows how to handle `.yaml` files. Make sure that the default app to open these files is set as one of the edtiors that you selected.
