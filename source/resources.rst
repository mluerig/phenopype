Computer vision
---------------

Computer vision (CV) is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the automatic and semiautomatic extraction of information from digital images. We recently wrote a review about CV in the context of ecology and evolution. In the paper we give an overview of the field and describe the primary types of image-based data. This might be a good starting point if you are new to digital image analysis and CV altogether.

Python
------

Python is a high-level programming language with a specific design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, e.g. through the use of indentation. It's aim is to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects, and is described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

YAML
----

"YAML" is a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language, commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting (source: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)

OpenCV
------

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions for real-time computer vision. OpenCV is powering most of phenopype's image analysis functions so that phenopype is - in large parts, but not exclusively - a wrapper for OpenCV. If you would like to see more OpenCV function being integrated into phenpype, please get in touch with me.
