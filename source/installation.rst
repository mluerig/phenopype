Installation
=============



1. Install Python
-----------------

To get started, download and install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ 
with Python 3. Anaconda is a scientific python distribution which comes with the most common 
scientific Python packages already built in.

You can test if the installation was successfull by opening a terminal and typing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda --version

If :code:`conda` is not recognized, use the anaconda prompt (e.g. through the `Anaconda Navigator 
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/>`_ OR add the path to your Anaconda 
installation directory (e.g. :code:`C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin`) to your environmental variables. Further
help can be found here:

If you prefer an "Rstudio-like" environment, you can use Phenopype from a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE). My favorite IDE is Spyder (https://www.spyder-ide.org/), but any other IDE will work too (a slightly outdated overview can be found `here <https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments>`_). Phenopype can of course also be run from the command line using :code:`python`.

2. Install phenopype
--------------------

You can install phenopype using :code:`pip`, and run it with :code:`spyder`:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install phenopype

However, to have fuller control over your python packages and to not mess up existing Python installation, I recommend to create a virtual environment using :code:`conda`:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create -n "pp" python=3.7 spyder

.. important::

	Adding :code:`spyder` behind the installation command will install Spyder to the new environment you have just created, otherwise it will be loaded from conda base environment where Phenopype may not be installed. 


Now activate the virtual environment and install Phenopype using `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda activate pp
	pip install phenopype

You can now use Phenopype by typing :code:`spyder` or :code:`python` into the command line. If you are unsure to proceed, consult the `tutorials <tutorial_0.html>`_.


2.1 Update Phenopype
""""""""""""""""""""

For regular major and minor releases:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install phenopype -U

2.2 Install hotfixes
""""""""""""""""""""

To install bug fixes for a current installation:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/archive/fix.zip -U

2.3 Install developmental version
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To update to the latest unreleased version of Phenopype:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/archive/latest.zip -U

.. important::

	Any modifications to the python environments or `Spyder`, should only be done using :code:`conda`, but modifications to `phenopype`, 
	its dependencies or other python packages should only be done using :code:`pip`. Mixing the two installers may break your python enviroment.



3. Choose a text editor
-----------------------

The high throughout method in Phenopype currently requires a text editor to be installed that **does not lock the file** - `read about file locking here <https://superuser.com/a/855057/970488>`_. 

.. important::

	Your OS needs to know how to handle `.yaml` files. Make sure that the default app to open these files is set as one of the edtiors that you selected.

For Windows, notepad works. However, I recommend `Notepad++`, which supports syntax highlighting and has many other useful features: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ Make sure that Windows "knows" how to open ".yaml" files: you double click a file, and nothing happens, you need to right click, go to "open with", and select a text editor as the default application for this file ending.

For Linux `Vim` or `Nano` (are already installed on most Linux distributions), and for MacOS, `Nano` or `brackets` could work http://brackets.io/.
