Known bugs
==========
- any OS: high GUI window sometimes crashes. workaround: use "cv2.destroyAllWindows()", or restart kernel
- on macOS, the high throughput workflow crashes when watchdog and opencv interact ("segmentation fault")

1.0.9 
-----
bugfix:
    - last scroll while zoom out scrambles the shown canvas
	- draw/mask in edit mode: indexing issues that would remove previously created drawings or masks
	- remove duplicate mask coordinate feedback 
- added docstrings for texture features
- reworked yaml-parser: now also duplicate "steps" (segmentation, visualization, etc.) possible 
- pype: finish now with CTRL+ENTER, otherwise the pype-operation starts over
- create_mask and draw have new mode (edit): allows to pick up on previous work and add or remove masks and drawings
- draw: print all drawings in the same function, for previewing
- draw/mask: "canvas" option to draw directly onto current canvas (and on underlying binary mask)


1.0.8
-----
bugfix:
	- create mask in edit mode would edit all masks (not just the one with the selected label)
	- pypi readme markdown formatting
- rewritten create_mask function to match drawing

1.0.7
-----
bugfix:
	- create_scale in interactive template mode did not get saved
	- fixed raw.file in proj. lists issue
- draw_contours now accepts previously run contour-files via "compare" argument
- create_mask window now has the same size as pype-window
- create_ mask and draw now have edit mode: add and modify previous runs


1.0.6
-----
bugfix:
	- tutorial 2: NoneType error when drawing contours under low throughput (fixes https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/issues/7)
	- tutorial 5: unexpected keyword when drawing polylines (fixes https://github.com/mluerig/phenopype/issues/8)
	- presets to all examples added
- new feature in measurement module: texture_features calculates 93 texture features (using pyradiomics as dependency)
- example 8 added

1.0.5
-----
bugfix:
	- data_dir on project load 
- new feature in measurement module: shape_features calculates 41 shape features
- example 3 added

1.0.4
-----
- new feature in measurement module: colour_intensity can now also measure the background of detected objects
- automated testing and CI implemented
- collect_results project method implemented
- all tutorials online, most examples online

1.0.3
-----
- renamed visualization functions to "draw_"-prefix to indicate that they are actually modifying the canvas (e.g. "show_contours" is now "draw_contours")
- "dirpath" option added to container (at initialization and saving)
- unified measurement and visualization arguments (e.g. "text_size" now is "label_size" and "label_col" now is "label_colour")
- skeletonization procedure implemented
- watershed algorithm implemented
- fix mask application in threshold
- create scale has now a mask function distinct of the template argument
- examples 1 and 2 added
- testing coverage ~ 60 %

1.0.2
-----
bugfix: 
	- pype: check if container has image or is NoneType
- Tutorials 1 + 2 improved
- Example 2 added (low throughput
- Docstrings to main, utils and preprocessing added

1.0.1
------
bugfix:
	- if resize==1, load_images will pass none to pype
- Tutorial 1 (Python intro) and Tutorial 2 (Phenopype workflow) added
- added update and development to installation doc

1.0.0
------
new major release - breaks all existing versions



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



0.10.0
------
bugfix:
- add_files with multiple ex- or include argument created duplicated filelists


0.9.0
------
- New feature: scale (former scale_maker) can now automatically equalize histograms via interpolation. Was mostly inspired by this SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32655686/histogram-matching-of-two-images-in-python-2-x
- renamed "scale_maker" method to "scale", and subfunctions, too. tutorials updated. more name changes to come towards a more intuitive naming convention
- show_img can now show multiple images when list is provided
- 

0.8.0
------
- scale_maker is completely reworked: now has zoom and onscreen notifications for mm/pixel info. measuring scale and making a template for detection are now two separate functions (measure_scale and make_scale_template)
- documentation and API reference for tracking module added 
- test for scale added

0.7.2
------
- landmark_maker has now (limited) mousewheel zooming functionality
- changed instructions for phenopype installation: make virtual env in conda for better package control (e.g. avoid different opencv versions)

0.7.1
------
bugfix:
- "filename not found" when no objects were found

0.7.0
------
- full landmark functionality added (refer to "landmark_maker" readme in the docs)
- additionally: measure length of curvy specimens from within the landmarking function ("arc")
- generic image registration (aka feature recognition) added, will be properly introduced and documented in the next version 


0.6.1
------
- "scale_maker" can return now has attribute "mask_obj" to pass on to "object_finder" (tuple of 3)
bugfix:
- missing "filetypes" argument in "project_finder" help
- default value for "factor in "scale.detect"


0.6.0
------
- integration with opencv-contrib-python==3.4.5.20
- tracking functionality added, integration with trackpy
- testing environment in place, integration with pytest
- initialize classes directly with image
- tutorials included for basic python (1) and object finding (2)
Known bugs:
- base "fillyPoly" sometimes breaks - culprit numpy datatype?
- base.polygon_maker "include=False" excludes everything


0.5.1
------
- functions take numpy array in addition to string with path to image
- bugfix: opencv-contrib-python version 3.* 


0.5.0
------
- object_finder functions streamlined and "skeletonize" algorithm added
- better documentation with docstrings 
- docstring integration with sphinx 
- __init__ rework for sphinx integration


0.4.11
------
- first release to pypi
