    "# Tutorial 3: The three phenopype workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of scientific images can be an iterative process that may require users to go back and forth, trying different processing steps and check how to improve results. Later, when the best functions and appropriate settings are found and efficient data collection has priority, image analysis should be efficient and with minimal user input to increase throughput and reproducibility. In phenopype, users can choose from three different workflows that are useful for different stages in the process of scientific image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three workflows, users assemble a stack (or sequence) of computer vision functions to analyze an image (Fig 1). The functions are available from phenopypes five core modules: **preprocessing, segmentation, measurement, export and visualization** ([see API reference](api.html#image-analysis-core-modules)). The major difference between the three workflows lies in the degree of code-explicitness, i.e. the need to write code for every step of the analysis, and in the degree of reproducibility, i.e. documentation of code and the results it produces. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Workflow | Use case | Operation principle | Code explicitness | Data reproducibility |\n",
    "|:---|:---------|:------------|:---|:---|\n",
    "| **Prototyping** | analysis prototyping, self education and evaluation | images are loaded as arrays and functions are applied one by one | High | Low |\n",
    "| **Low throughput** | single pictures and very small datasets | images are loaded into phenopype containers | Medium | low |\n",
    "| **High throughput**  | medium and large datasets - default analysis workflow | images are loaded from a phenopype project directory tree, and analyzed with the [pype](api.html#pype-high-throughput-function) method | Low | High |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **prototyping** and **low throughput** workflow, users write a phenopype function stack in directly in Python code. This is recommended for users who wish to familiarize themselves with the basic principles of computer vision and to explore the phenopype function library. The **high throughput** workflow is for production stage, when image analysis should be efficient and data collection reproducible for other users and scientists. In this tutorial, you will learn the differences between the three workflows."

This is useful for phenopype beginners who want to explore what the different functions do, or for troubleshooting, because all intermediate steps can be inspected. \n",

    "First we need to provide the path to an image on the hard drive to `load_image`, which imports the file as a three-channel [1] numpy array (*ndarray*), together with image meta data (file name, exposure, dimensions, etc.) as a pandas *DataFrame*. The array gets passed on to the `threshold` function, which will return a binary array of the same dimensions. This array needs to be passed on to the `find_contours` function, which will return a dictionary with the detected contours. Finally, the dataframe can be exported as a csv file with `save_contours`. By passing on the initially created meta-data, this function will also included filename and image dimensions in the exported csv.  \n",
