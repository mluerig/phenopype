    "Analysis of scientific images can be an iterative process that may require frequent user input to preprocess images, adjust settings and evaluate the obtained results. In phenopype, users can start this process by identifying the appropriate functions and settings to analyse a series of images (i.e. which segmentation algorithms is to be used). For the actual analysis, users then can switch to a workflow that has higher throughput and is more reproducible. Phenopype offers workflows that are appropriate for all stages of the scientific process:\n",

However, the degree of user interaction, visual feedback and the mode by which these functions are applied to images differ, as well as reproducibility. \n",

    "The low throughput workflow starts with the path to an image that is stored on the hard drive. `load_image` imports the file as a three-channel [1] numpy array (*ndarray*), together with image meta data (file name, exposure, dimensions, etc.) as a pandas *DataFrame*. The array gets passed on to the `threshold` function, which will return a binary array of the same dimensions. This array needs to be passed on to the `find_contours` function, which will return a dictionary with the detected contours. This dictionary, together with the original array, can then be passed to the `colour_intensity` function. This function will collect the average color value from within the perimeter coordinates for each contour and return a pandas dataframe containing those values. Finally, the dataframe can be exported as a csv file with `save_colour`. By passing on the initially created meta-data, the function will automatically expand the provided columns of meta-info into the exported csv.  \n",

The advantage of using containers is that they don’t litter the global environment and namespace, while still containing all intermediate steps (e.g. binary masks or contour DataFrames).
