    "Analysis of scientific images can be an iterative process that may require users to go back and forth, try different processing steps and check the obtained results. At later stages, when the appropriate functions and settings have been identified and efficient data production has priority, the workflow should be streamlined to increase throughput and reproducibility. In phenopype, users can choose from three different workflows that accomodate all stages of scientific image analysis:\n",

The major differences between the three workflows are the degree of user interaction, visual feedback, code-explicitness, as well as reproducibility. \n",

    "In the **prototyping** and **low throughput** workflow, users write a phenopype function stack in directly in Python code.

    "The low throughput workflow starts with the path to an image that is stored on the hard drive. `load_image` imports the file as a three-channel [1] numpy array (*ndarray*), together with image meta data (file name, exposure, dimensions, etc.) as a pandas *DataFrame*. The array gets passed on to the `threshold` function, which will return a binary array of the same dimensions. This array needs to be passed on to the `find_contours` function, which will return a dictionary with the detected contours. This dictionary, together with the original array, can then be passed to the `colour_intensity` function. This function will collect the average color value from within the perimeter coordinates for each contour and return a pandas dataframe containing those values. Finally, the dataframe can be exported as a csv file with `save_colour`. By passing on the initially created meta-data, the function will automatically expand the provided columns of meta-info into the exported csv.  \n",
